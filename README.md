This is the source code of my blog-------http://pengzhenghong.cn. 

The modifications is based on wordpress 3.9.7, I named it wordpress-plus.

Note: There are many user experience improvement you wouldn't have been able to see, Like C++ã€€matlab java shortcut keys in the toolbar of TinyMCE , etc. And I have changed config.php, you should adapted this file to your situation before running it.
